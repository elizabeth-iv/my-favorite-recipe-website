    <h1>Method</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>In a bowl, mix your dry ingredients: the flour, crushed cardamom, yeast and sugar. Mix everything until well combined.</li>
        <li> Add the water while mixing the content, followed by the milk. When all the content are roughly mixed together, melt the ghee and rub it all in. Knead the dough until it is no longer sticking to your hands and it soft and elastic. Allow it to rest and rise for a minimum of 40 minutes or until it has <i>doubled</i> in style</li>
        <li> Once that is done. Divide your dough into four balls, each about the size of an orange. Roll each one out and divide it into quarters. Heat your oil and proceed to fry until each side is golden brown. </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and serve on its own with chai or coffee</li>

        <h3>Tips and Warnings</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baking powder can be used in place of instant yeast. If you use baking powder, the dough only needs to rest for 10 minutes and won’t need to rest after it’s divided.</li>
                    <li>The dough can be mixed and left to rise overnight.</li>
                </ul>
